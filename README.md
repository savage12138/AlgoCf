# Algorithm Comparison
This project implement and analyze two different code segments for initializing an [NxN] matrix (indexed as A[0][0] to A[N-1][N-1]). Table 1 illustrates the result of this initialization for N=5. Compare the actual running times for matrices of various sizes, starting with 10x10 and increasing in multiple steps to 5000x5000. (If your system cannot handle a matrix that large, you may need to stop at a smaller size.)
